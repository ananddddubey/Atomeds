We had created a terminal based platform where we are taking the input from the user about their symtoms and based on that we are redirecting them to the particular model and then user had to give input of their health status and the model will give the risk factor along with the risk Percentage. 

This is a project where i had created 4 models:
**1- Heart Disease Prediction
2- Asthma Prediction
3- Allergy Prediction
4- Diabetes Prediction**

These are 4 models which is trained using different Algorithms (**CNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM**) and we are getting all the model's accuracy <80 % 
If you  want to check out our model don't forget to run the requirement file


command ( pip install -r requirement.txt ) 

Run the above command to install the packages


If you like the project don't forget to give a star.
